				Dont want to partition your disk? No worries, one of your hero classmates wrote this handy guide, covers installing and configuring VMWare, installing linux on a virtual machine, and getting Eclipse CDT up and running.<br>  
				Possible problem: VMWare may throw an error when launching a VM,  if so make sure the 'virtualization' setting is enabled in the system bios.  To get to the bios, press F12 or delete when booting up. It can also be accessed in Windows Settings -> Advanced System Startup -> configure UEFI settings.   The setting is called something along the lines of "support for Intel VT-x"
