	 PATH (echo $PATH)
	alias
	install (.deb, tar, run) package manager verses manage yourself
	desktop shortcuts

scripting bash(second shebang is better, (no spaces, must be on first line))
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash 
# A sample Bash script
echo Hello World!

By convention file has .sh extension and must have executable permissions
The advantage of #!/usr/bin/env python  or bash or whatever is that it will use whatever python executable appears first in the user's $PATH.

When executing from cur deir put ./ in front unless curr dir is on path

#!/usr/bin/env bash 
cp $1 $2
# Let's verify the copy worked
echo Details for $2
ls -lh $2

$1, $2, ...
The first, second, etc command line arguments to the script.
variable=value
To set a value for a variable. Remember, no spaces on either side of =
Quotes " '
Double will do variable substitution, single will not.
variable=$( command )
Save the output of a command into a variable
export var1
Make the variable var1 available to child processes.
